# The Data Science Challenge

To have a better understand on how u work, your strengths and weakness, we're proposing a challenge!

You are going to work with the [NYC metro database](http://web.mta.info/developers/turnstile.html), which has the following [field description](http://web.mta.info/developers/resources/nyct/turnstile/ts_Field_Description.txt). To help your work, we present the database already merged at this [link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1CuE9I4x0_Agm2BMkWfnSSbiGm0-pTDuc).

The main goal is to forecast the number of people that uses the metro. You can let the imagination work and do this the way you prefer, chosing the temporal/spatial sampling rate (by station/turnstile, day/hour/week etc). This choice is part of the challenge.

Please, do not put everything in a huge ANN model directly, take a nice look at the data and perform a great exploratory data analysis. We prefer to receive the results in a notebook way, but if you wish to provide a nice script, there is no problem =) (If it's nicely commented, of course).

Good Luck!
